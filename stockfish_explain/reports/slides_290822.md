# What is an explanation?

- **Interpretation**
    - Interpret means to explain or to present in understandable terms
- **Explanation**
    - **explanations are... the currency in which we exchanged beliefs**
    - Citing of a cause
        - The asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs
    - "Necessary connection" between events
    - Deductive reasoning
    - Deductive-nomological model (Carl Hempel)
    - Some explanations can be probabalistic 
    - **Understanding is a matter of expectability**
        - You understand X when you show that X was to expected

# Deductive-nomological model 
- logical proofs
- providing some sense of mechanism
- **Explanandum** (Why is there smoke?) and **explanan** (Because there is fire)

- Steps:
    - Statement of relevant laws of nature: L1, L2, ... , Ln
    - Statement of initial conditions: C1, C2, ... , Cn
    - Statement of explanation
 
- "The symmetry thesis"
    - **Prediction and explanation differ only in terms of when they are given**
        - They have the same logical structure


---


# Inductive-Statistical model
- Similar as Deductive-nomological model
    - Probably, ....
    - What is to expect

# Objections to DN Model and IS Model

- Not all explanations appeal to laws
- Sometimes we don't know the laws
- The symmetry thesis fails to explain less likely outcome
- Not all predictions can be explanations
    - We can make good predictions using theories that we know are false
        - We could predict the planets trajectories when we thought the earth was the center of the universe
        - But we could not explain why
- Sometimes a DN model is not sufficient for an explanation
    - Hard when events are not directional
    - When causality is not present

# Objections to DN Model and IS Model

- Explanatory irrelevance
    - When we miss the causal 
    - If the law we state isn't the cause 
    - Can be checked with experiments
        - all X and Y is Z, John is X and Y, thus John is Z
            - we must check if conclusion can be derived after removing either X or Y
    - Some explanations are simply not useful (while not wrong)
        1)  All males that take birth control pills fail to get pregnant
        2)  John is a male who takes birth control pills
        - John fails to get pregnant
- Explanation is dependent on what we know
    1) John takes pencilin
    2) John gets cured from infection
    - We don't know if the infection was pencillin resistant, johns immune system could have ben the cause

# The Causal Mechanical Model

- Statistical relevance
    - the explanans should increase the probability of the explanandum
    - P(pregnancy ̣| male & birth control) = P(pregnancy | male) = 0
        - Being male screens off taking birth control
        - Exposes only correlation, not causationn
- We can talk about causality without laws
- Laplacean Deamon
    - able to predict future events, but nothing else
    - maybe expectability is not sufficient, because he would not understand why things happen
- Distinction between contributing causes and counteracting causes

# Can we derive the Explanandum from the Explanans?

- Explanandum (A statement)
- Explanan (The sentence that does the explaining)

# Assessment of the quality of an explanation
## Can we derive the result from the explanation?

- Pre-requisite   
    - Real evaluation = Black is better
    - Theory: black has a good bishop, white has a bad knight
- Can we remove individually and observe the change in evaluation to probe for the strenght/contribution of the pieces?
1) Evaluate individual piece importance (by removing them individually)
    - WB, BN
2) Remove both of them and evaluate board position
    - Base eval
3) Can we derive why black is better using this information?
    - Base eval + WB + BN = Derived evaluation
    - Real evaluation == Derived evaluation?
