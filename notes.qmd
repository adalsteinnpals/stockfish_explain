# Meeting Notes


## 2022-11-23

We went over the following topics:

- Paper was rejected, even though the most critical reveiwer increased his evaluation.
- It only makes sens to experiment with very simple concepts. 
- We talked about the probing problem discussed in the Chess Knowledge paper. 
    - To evaluate the models mentioned in the paper, we would need to create an experiment.
- We talked about comparing probing methods for two different models. 

TODO:

- [ ] Add more probing models
- [ ] Compare the probing accuracy for the same model at different training steps


## 2022-11-30

Work done:

- Added a neural network probe
- Probed the medium autoencoder during training with three different probing methods
- "The degree of effort" approach
