# Meeting Notes


## 2022-11-23

We went over the following topics:

- Paper was rejected, even though the most critical reveiwer increased his evaluation.
- It only makes sens to experiment with very simple concepts. 
- We talked about the probing problem discussed in the Chess Knowledge paper. 
    - To evaluate the models mentioned in the paper, we would need to create an experiment.
- We talked about comparing probing methods for two different models. 

TODO:

- [ ] Add more probing models
- [ ] Compare the probing accuracy for the same model at different training steps


## 2022-12-05

Work done:

- Added a neural network probe
- Probed the medium autoencoder during training with three different probing methods
- "The degree of effort" approach reviewed
- Implemented boosting algorithm to approximate degree of effort

Discussion:

- We saw that a linear probe (and the decision tree probe) showed a decrease in probing accuracy in a compressed state while the network was clearly improving. 
- The neural network probe did not show this behavior.
- Thus if we want to use probing to evaluate the quality of a compressed state, we should use a neural network probe.


TODO:

- [ ] Use a neural network probe (linear and decision tree) to evaluate Stockfish NNUE
- [ ] Check if the boosting algorithm sheds light on concept representation.
